# Prescriptive Process Monitoring

This repository contains all the scripts required to reproduce the experiments from the paper:
"Fire Now, Fire Later: Alarm-Based Systems for Prescriptive Process Monitoring" by Stephan A. Fahrenkrog-Petersen, Niek Tax, Irene Teinemaa, Marlon,Dumas, Massimiliano de Leoni, Fabrizio Maria Maggi, and Matthias Weidlich.

The code is written in Python 3. 

A lot of the code in this repository was based on code from Irene Teinemaa and Niek Tax, available here:

## R-Scripts

The R-scripts in this repository were used to generate the respective figures in the paper. They used the results generated by the approach implemented within the Python scripts.
